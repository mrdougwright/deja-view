- Improve Exceptions
  - Print comment node on each exception (linked automatically in chrome to the elements view)

- Set node on the view ('this') for each def function
   (that way we don't have to keep track of node passing overhead)

- partial application, eg. view.def('add', 1, function(n) { return n + 1})

- add an explicit "def_lazy" that passes in un-evaluated params. def by default will instead evaluate eagerly
